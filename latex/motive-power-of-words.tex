% Document Begins
\begin{document}
\maketitle
% \tableofcontents Optional table-of-contents
% \clearpage clears page on table of contents so content starts on new page.

% Includes content body. If the essay is very long, it might make sense to split
% the content across multiple .tex files, and include them all here, e.g.
% \input{sections/preamble.tex}
\input{sections/body.tex}

% Lists all works in the citations.bib file in the bibliography, even if some
% where not cited using inline citations.
\nocite{*}

% Creates Bibliography on new page. By default \printbibliography creates the
% 'Works Cited' heading. By suppressing it, we are able to use our own heading.
\clearpage
\section*{Bibliography}
\printbibliography[heading=none]
